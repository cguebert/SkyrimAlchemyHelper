# SkyrimAlchemyHelper

Utility for the Skyrim video game: analyses the user's mods and game save, then computes the list of craftable potions. There are various ways to filter and sort the potions list, and it can optimize the discovery of ingredients effects.

For any question or bug report, write to me on GitHub or at the utility page on NexusMods.com
